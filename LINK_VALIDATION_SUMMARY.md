12. sample-arch-package: 43 links
13. smartpath: 53 links
14. sovd-diagnostic-ecosystem-platform-architecture: 48 links

## Fixes Applied

### future-mobility-consumer-platform (COMPLETED ✓)
Fixed all 36 broken links by:

1. **Created missing files**:
   - `DEVELOPER_USAGE_GUIDE.md` - Developer quickstart guide
   - `docs/best-practices.md` - Integration guidelines
   - `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive developer guide
   - All API implementation guides (api-2, api-8, api-9, api-10, api-14, api-24, api-29, api-31, api-33, api-34)
   - All Postman collections for each API

2. **Fixed incorrect paths**:
   - `docs/DEVELOPER_USAGE_GUIDE.md` - Fixed link to DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md
   - `docs/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Fixed link to api-specs
   - `docs/MODE_SYSTEM_GUIDE.md` - Fixed link to deployment guide

### Diagram Rendering (VERIFIED ✓)
- Mermaid diagrams are rendering correctly in all tested documents
- No raw HTML placeholders or text markers visible
- Tested in:
  - future-mobility-consumer-platform/docs/architecture/technical-design.md
  - future-mobility-consumer-platform/docs/architecture/security.md
  - future-mobility-consumer-platform/docs/architecture/deployment.md
  - demo-labsdashboards/docs/development/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md

## Test Implementation

Created comprehensive Playwright test (`e2e/link-validation.spec.ts`) that:
1. Scans all repositories in cloned-repositories directory
2. Finds all markdown files recursively
3. Extracts all local links (excluding external URLs and anchors)
4. Validates each link exists on disk and is accessible via API
5. Generates detailed report with broken links grouped by repository
6. Tests Mermaid/PlantUML diagram rendering

## Next Steps

957 broken links remain in other repositories that need to be fixed. The test infrastructure is now in place to validate that "100% OF THE LINKS IN 100% OF THE DOCUMENTS IN 100% OF THE REPOS" work correctly.

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run comprehensive link validation
npx playwright test link-validation --grep="Validate ALL links"

# Run diagram rendering test
npx playwright test link-validation --grep="Verify Mermaid"

# Check specific repository
node scripts/fix-broken-links.js
```
