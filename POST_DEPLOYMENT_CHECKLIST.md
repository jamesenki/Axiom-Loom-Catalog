# Post-Deployment Checklist - Axiom Loom Catalog

## Quick Verification Protocol

### 1. Infrastructure Health Check ⚡
```bash
# Container status verification
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}"

# Expected: All containers UP, backend/nginx/redis HEALTHY
```

### 2. Build Quality Gates ⚡
```bash
# TypeScript compilation
npm run type-check  # Must exit with code 0

# Application build
npm run build      # Must complete without errors
```

### 3. API Validation ⚡
```bash
# Health endpoint
curl -f http://localhost/api/health

# Authentication test
curl -X POST http://localhost/api/auth/local-login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@localhost","password":"admin"}'
```

### 4. Frontend Verification ⚡
- [ ] Navigate to http://localhost
- [ ] Verify "Axiom Loom Catalog" title displays
- [ ] Check browser console for 0 errors
- [ ] Test login with admin@localhost/admin
- [ ] Confirm repository list loads
- [ ] Verify search functionality works

### 5. Performance Check ⚡
- [ ] Page load time < 2 seconds
- [ ] API response time < 500ms
- [ ] No memory leaks visible
- [ ] Responsive design working

## Agent Coordination Checklist

### DevOps Agent Responsibilities ✅
- [ ] Container orchestration completed
- [ ] Build validation passed
- [ ] Service health confirmed
- [ ] Deployment scripts executed
- [ ] Infrastructure monitoring active

### QA Agent Responsibilities ✅
- [ ] Zero-tolerance error checking completed
- [ ] E2E test suite executed
- [ ] Browser validation performed
- [ ] API endpoint testing completed
- [ ] User acceptance criteria verified

### Documentation Agent Responsibilities ✅
- [ ] Issue resolution documented
- [ ] Process workflow recorded
- [ ] Success metrics captured
- [ ] Prevention measures noted
- [ ] Knowledge transfer completed

## Success Criteria

### Must Have (Blocking) 🚫
- ✅ Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ All containers running/healthy
- ✅ Frontend renders without blank screens
- ✅ Authentication flow functional
- ✅ API health check passes
- ✅ Zero browser console errors

### Nice to Have (Non-blocking) ⚠️
- ⚠️ Frontend health check status (functional despite health check)
- ⚠️ Minor performance optimizations
- ⚠️ Additional test coverage

## Rollback Triggers

Execute rollback if ANY of these occur:
- TypeScript compilation errors
- Blank screens in browser
- API health check failures
- Authentication system broken
- Database connectivity lost
- Multiple container failures

## Quick Rollback Procedure
```bash
# Emergency rollback
docker-compose down
git checkout HEAD~1
npm install
npm run build
docker-compose up -d
```

## Contact Points

### Issue Escalation
1. **Infrastructure Issues:** DevOps Agent protocols
2. **Quality Issues:** QA Agent validation
3. **Process Issues:** Documentation Agent review

### Success Confirmation
**All checks passed = DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL**
