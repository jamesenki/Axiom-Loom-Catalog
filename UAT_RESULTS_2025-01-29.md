# User Acceptance Test Results - Axiom Loom Catalog

**Date**: January 29, 2025  
**Environment**: Local Development  
**Version**: Production Build

## üöÄ Deployment Status

### ‚úÖ Application Successfully Deployed
- **Frontend**: Running on http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: Running on http://localhost:3001
- **Build Status**: Successful with warnings (non-critical ESLint issues)
- **Bundle Size**: Optimized (117.74 kB main vendor bundle)

## üß™ Test Execution Summary

### Automated E2E Tests
- **Total Tests**: 285
- **Test Suites**: Design System, Styled Components, Repository Management
- **Browsers**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit
- **Status**: Running with some failures due to strict mode violations

### Key Findings

#### ‚úÖ Successful Features
1. **Application Loads**: Frontend successfully serves the React application
2. **Real Repository Data**: Using actual cloned repositories from:
   - future-mobility-consumer-platform (with 10+ API collections)
   - future-mobility-fleet-platform (with 14+ API collections)
   - future-mobility-oems-platform (with 14+ API collections)
   - nslabsdashboards (GraphQL APIs)
   - And 9 more repositories
3. **API Server Running**: Backend server successfully started with search index (548 entries)
4. **Performance**: Fast load times, optimized bundles

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Identified
1. **Strict Mode Violations**: Some E2E tests failing due to multiple elements with same text
2. **Network Timeouts**: Some tests timing out waiting for network idle
3. **API Endpoint Mismatch**: Frontend expecting different API routes than backend provides
