# Fix Application Orchestration Workflow

## Overview
Systematic workflow to fix all application issues and ensure 100% test passage.

## Phase 1: Diagnosis (Root Cause Analysis Agent)
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Collect All Errors
    actions:
      - Run Playwright tests and capture console errors
      - Check Docker container logs
      - Analyze build output for warnings
      - Inspect browser DevTools for runtime errors
    
  - name: Create Error Dependency Graph
    actions:
      - Map which errors cause other errors
      - Identify true root causes
      - Document error categories:
        * Theme/styling errors
        * Module resolution errors
        * API connection errors
        * React rendering errors
```

## Phase 2: Foundation Fixes (Theme & Build Agents)
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Fix Theme System
    agent: Theme Migration Agent
    actions:
      - Audit all theme imports
      - Create proper theme provider setup
      - Fix styled-components theme access
      - Validate theme structure matches usage
    
  - name: Fix Build Configuration
    agent: Build Configuration Agent
    actions:
      - Resolve all TypeScript errors
      - Fix module resolution issues
      - Ensure proper polyfills
      - Zero build warnings
```

## Phase 3: Feature Implementation (Test-Driven Fix Agent)
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Fix Core Features
    priority_order:
      1. Homepage rendering
      2. Repository list display
      3. Navigation functionality
      4. API data fetching
      5. Document rendering
      6. Search functionality
    
    for_each_feature:
      - Run specific test suite
      - Implement missing functionality
      - Fix component errors
      - Validate tests pass
      - Check for regressions
```

## Phase 4: Integration (Integration Validation Agent)
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Service Integration
    checks:
      - MongoDB connection and queries
      - Redis caching functionality
      - Backend API endpoints
      - Frontend-backend communication
      - Authentication flow
  
  - name: Full System Validation
    actions:
      - Run complete E2E test suite
      - Performance benchmarks
      - Load testing
      - Security validation
```

## Phase 5: Deployment Validation
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Pre-deployment Checks
    validations:
      - TypeScript: 0 errors
      - ESLint: 0 errors
      - Unit tests: 100% pass
      - Integration tests: 100% pass
      - E2E tests: 100% pass
      - Build size: Under threshold
      - Performance: Meets targets
  
  - name: Deployment
    actions:
      - Build production artifacts
      - Deploy to Docker
      - Run smoke tests
      - Monitor for 5 minutes
```

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All 1200 tests passing
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] All pages load with content
- [ ] All API endpoints functional
- [ ] Search works correctly
- [ ] Documents render with working links
- [ ] Performance targets met

## Rollback Strategy
If any phase fails:
1. Document the failure precisely
2. Rollback to last working state
3. Create targeted fix
4. Re-run from failed phase

## Monitoring
- Real-time test results dashboard
- Error aggregation and reporting
- Performance metrics tracking
- Success rate per phase
