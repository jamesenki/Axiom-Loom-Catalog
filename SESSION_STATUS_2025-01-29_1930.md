- ✅ Testing documentation (docs/TESTING.md)
- ✅ Test utilities and mock services

#### Phase 3: Enhancement (Partial - 4/6 Complete)
- ✅ PlantUML integration (backend + frontend)
- ✅ Mermaid diagram support
- ✅ Advanced search and filtering
- ✅ Performance optimization
- ⏳ Marketing-focused UI polish
- ⏳ Comprehensive testing

### 🚀 Recent Accomplishments (This Session)

1. **PlantUML Integration**
   - Backend rendering service at `/api/plantuml/render`
   - React component with error handling
   - Hook for markdown integration
   - Full documentation with examples

2. **Mermaid Diagram Support**
   - Client-side rendering component
   - Automatic detection in markdown
   - Support for all diagram types
   - Integration with EnhancedMarkdownViewer

3. **Advanced Search**
   - Full-text search with fuzzy matching
   - Faceted filtering
   - Real-time search suggestions
   - Global search modal (Cmd/Ctrl + K)

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Code splitting & lazy loading
   - Virtual scrolling for large lists
   - Service worker for offline support
   - Webpack optimizations
   - Build size: Main bundle only 9.75 kB (gzipped)

### 🐛 Known Issues & Warnings

1. **Build Warnings (Non-Critical)**
   - Unused variables in several components
   - Missing dependencies in useEffect hooks
   - Can be addressed during code quality phase

2. **TypeScript Strict Mode**
   - Some `any` types remain
   - Excluded test files from build to avoid global type issues

3. **API Endpoints**
   - Client components updated to use API calls
   - Server-side services moved to `.server.ts` files
   - Node.js dependencies removed from client bundle

### 🔧 Environment & Configuration

- **Node/npm versions:** Working correctly
- **Build System:** react-app-rewired with custom webpack config
- **TypeScript:** Configured with ES2015 target and downlevelIteration
- **Service Worker:** Enabled for production builds only
- **API Endpoints:** Configured for localhost:3001

### 📋 Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Marketing-Focused UI Polish**
   - Professional design system
   - EY branding integration
   - Responsive layouts
   - Animation and transitions
   - Loading states improvement
   - Error boundaries

2. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Unit test coverage improvement
   - Integration tests for new features
   - E2E tests with Playwright
   - Performance testing
   - Accessibility testing

3. **Future Enhancements (Post Phase 3)**
   - API Explorer interactive testing
   - Real-time count updates
   - Repository categorization
   - Recently viewed tracking
   - Bookmarking functionality

### 💻 Commands to Resume

```bash
# Start development environment
cd /Users/lisasimon/repos/eyns-innovation-repos/eyns-ai-experience-center
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build

# Analyze bundle size
npm run build:analyze
```

### 📝 Git Status at End of Session

```
Current branch: main
Last commit: dfde367 feat(performance): implement comprehensive performance optimizations

Modified files ready for next session:
- None (all changes committed)
```

### 🎯 Session Goals for Next Time

1. Begin Marketing-Focused UI Polish
   - Design system setup
   - Component styling improvements
   - Professional layouts

2. Improve Test Coverage
   - Write tests for new components
   - Fix failing tests if any
   - Setup E2E testing

### 📌 Important Notes

- All Phase 3 performance optimizations are complete
- Build is working but has some ESLint warnings
- Service worker only activates in production builds
- PlantUML requires Java runtime on server
- Search API falls back to local search if server unavailable

### 🔑 Key Decisions Made

1. Used react-app-rewired instead of ejecting CRA
2. Implemented virtual scrolling for performance
3. Split client/server code to avoid Node.js in browser
4. Added service worker for offline capability
5. Used lazy loading for all route components
