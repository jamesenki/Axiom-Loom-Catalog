### Fleet Operator ROI Calculator

#### Current State (Annual Costs)
```
Fleet Size: _______ vehicles
Average Vehicle Value: $_______ per vehicle
Annual Maintenance Budget: $_______ 
Unplanned Downtime Hours: _______ hours/vehicle/year
Downtime Cost Rate: $_______ per hour
Warranty Claims: $_______ per vehicle/year
Insurance Premiums: $_______ per vehicle/year
```

#### Expected Improvements with AI Predictive Maintenance
```
‚úÖ 35% reduction in unplanned downtime
‚úÖ 30% reduction in maintenance costs
‚úÖ 20% reduction in warranty claims
‚úÖ 15% reduction in insurance premiums
‚úÖ 20% extension in vehicle lifespan
```

#### ROI Calculation Template

**Annual Savings Calculation:**
```
1. Downtime Savings = (Current Downtime Hours √ó 0.35) √ó Downtime Cost Rate √ó Fleet Size
2. Maintenance Savings = Current Maintenance Budget √ó 0.30
3. Warranty Savings = Current Warranty Claims √ó Fleet Size √ó 0.20
4. Insurance Savings = Current Insurance Premiums √ó Fleet Size √ó 0.15
5. Total Annual Savings = Sum of above savings
```

**Implementation Costs:**
```
1. Platform Subscription = Fleet Size √ó $45/vehicle/month √ó 12 months
2. Implementation Cost = $50,000 (one-time)
3. Training Cost = $25,000 (one-time)
4. Total First Year Cost = Platform Subscription + Implementation + Training
```

**ROI Calculation:**
```
Net Annual Benefit = Total Annual Savings - Platform Subscription
ROI = (Net Annual Benefit / Total First Year Cost) √ó 100%
Payback Period = Total First Year Cost / (Total Annual Savings / 12) months
```
